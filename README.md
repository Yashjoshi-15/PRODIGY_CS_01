# PRODIGY_CS_01
Implement Caesar Cipher

In this task, I developed a Python program that enables users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and earliest known encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

# HOW IT FUNCTIONS

Choose the option to encrypt or decrypt.

- Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.

- Enter the shift value (a positive integer) to shift the letters.

- The program will show output of the encrypted or decrypted message.

- The program only supports English alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and ignores other characters such as numbers and symbols.
= The shift value can be any positive integer.

# FUNTIONS USED IN 
- isaplha()- isalpha() String function examines a string for alphabetical characters and returns True only if the string contains all alphabetical characters, i.e. alphabets (A-Z, a-z); else returns False

- ord() -The ord() function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character.

- The shift() function moves data down by the specified number of periods (1 by default)
