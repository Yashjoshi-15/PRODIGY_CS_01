# PRODIGY_CS_01
Implement Caesar Cipher
In this task, I developed a Python program that enables users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and earliest known encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
